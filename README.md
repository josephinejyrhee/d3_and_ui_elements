# 08: D3 and UI Elements
Last class we started learning how to make our charts interactive using event listeners to detect mouse hovering so that we could display tooltips. What if we want to integrate HTML UI elements such as buttons or select dropdowns that alter the state of our chart? In this lesson we'll explore a couple methods for doing just that by revisiting our SVG bar chart from session 4 and Punchcard chart from session 5.

In this repo you'll find the completed code we used from modules 4 and 5. There are JS and CSS files for both. We'll start by linking our `index.html` file to the `barchart.js` and `barchart.css` files, and then adding a button to sort the bars by their values ascending or descending. We'll then move on to linking the `punchcard.js` and `punchcard.css` files, and adding a select dropdown so that a user can choose which site to render the chart from.
